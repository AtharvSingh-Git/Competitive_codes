# ðŸ§  Competitive Coding Stash: Level Up Edition ðŸ§ 

Yo, ready to crush those coding challenges and flex your problem-solving muscles? This repo is your cheat code for all things competitive coding.

## Why this repo is the GOAT:
- **Shortcuts to Sanity**
- **Crush the Curve**
- **Level Up, Boi**: Get faster, smarter, and basically unstoppable at problem-solving

## The Breakdown
### Number Theory Domination
- **Modular Arithmetic** â€“ keepin' it fresh under modulo
- **Euclidean Algorithm** â€“ GCD like a boss.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes** â€“ prime numbers, y'all.
- **Binary Exponentiation** â€“ powers in a flash.
- **Matrix Multiplication** â€“ matrices gettin' multiplied.
- **Combinatorics** â€“ count those possibilities.
- **Primes, Divisors, Multiples** â€“ the building blocks of numbers.

### Search Party: Binary and Ternary Style
- **Basic Binary Search** â€“ the OG of finding things fast.
- **Binary Search on Answer** â€“ when the answer itself is the puzzle.
- **Monotonic Functions** â€“ when things have a predictable flow.

### Dynamic Programming Supremacy
- **DP with Bitmasking (Rookie-Level)** â€“ taming complexity with bits.
- **DP on Trees (Rookie-Level)** â€“ conquering trees, one node at a time.

### Graph Theory is Where It's At
- **DFS and BFS** â€“ the graph exploration essentials.
- **Connected Components** â€“ those graph cliques.
- **Prim's Algo, Kruskal's Algo** â€“ finding the best paths.
- **Cycle Detection** â€“ loops begone!
- **Dijkstra's Algo, Floyd Warshall, Bellman Ford** â€“ shortest paths on lock.
- **DSU/UFDS (Bonus Points)** â€“ merging sets with style.

### Tree Power
- **Basic tree knowledge** â€“ roots, leaves, the whole fam.
- **DFS** â€“ deep dives into tree structures.
- **Binary Lifting** â€“ jumping up those tree levels efficiently.
- **LCA in LogN** â€“ finding ancestors like a pro.
- **DP on Trees** â€“ problem-solving, tree-style.

### STL Snippets: The MVPs
- Code shortcuts and STL magic for ultimate efficiency.

## The Lowdown:
- **Clarity > Confusion:** Skip the mindfcuk-_-'.. 'Tis the good stuff.
- **Fork, Experiment, Conquer:** Make this repo your own coding sandbox.
- **Collab Central:** Got a sick solution? Let's share and level up together.

## Roll Call: What Else?
